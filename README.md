# Unity N-Body Simulation

## Description

This repository contains a Unity project for simulating the N-body problem. Explore gravitational interactions between multiple bodies in a realistic environment.

## Features

- Real-time simulation of gravitational forces between multiple bodies.
- Customizable parameters for body masses, initial positions, velocities, and gravitational constants.
- Visualization of trajectories and orbits.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    https://github.com/FforPingu/nBody-s-representation-Unity2D.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Unity.

## Usage

1. Customize simulation parameters in Unity's Inspector panel.
2. Press Play to start the simulation.
3. Observe the gravitational interactions and trajectories of the bodies.
4. Adjust parameters and experiment with different scenarios.
